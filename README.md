Project 1: Predicting Cost of Insurance Overview This project aims to predict the cost of insurance premiums for individuals based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.

Dataset The dataset used for this project includes information about individuals and their insurance premiums.

Model We developed a regression model using the Random Forest Classifier to predict insurance costs based on the provided attributes.

Deployment The model for predicting insurance costs is deployed using Flask, enabling users to input relevant information and receive estimated insurance premium costs.

Project 2: Binary Classification (Heart Disease) Overview This project focuses on binary classification to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes.

Dataset The dataset used for this project contains information about patients, including their age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.

Model We trained a machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier to predict the presence of heart disease based on the provided attributes.

Deployment The trained model is deployed using Flask, allowing users to input their medical information and obtain predictions regarding their risk of heart disease.
